Description

The idea of the "Quiz Project" is displaying some random quizzes which is generated with API Requests,
then storing them on a sqlite3 database.
The quizzes then displayed by their names out from the database to a web page "all_quizes"
which have all quizzes names and a "delete me" button for every quiz.

a. By clicking on "ADD QUIZ" button it will request a new quiz with API Request and save it in the database
and display its name immediately on the same HTML page "all_quizes".

b. By clicking on the quiz name, the web app will navigate to another webpage "quiz", which contains the quiz questions
with its choices and a "submit" button,
when we click on "submit" after answering the questions, a new web page will be displayed "solve".
in "solve" page, we find our checked answers, the correct answers and our score for this quiz.

c. By clicking on "delete me" button, the quiz will be deleted from the the database and disappear from the web page too.
